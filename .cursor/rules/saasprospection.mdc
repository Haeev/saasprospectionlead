1. General Overview
This project is a SaaS platform for lead generation and prospecting, designed to help entrepreneurs and businesses find qualified leads based on specific criteria. Users will be able to create a profile, define a geographical area, and obtain a list of businesses that match their criteria, including publicly available contact information.

2. Core Functionalities
User Profile Creation: Users can define their ideal customer profile based on industry, company size, location, and other relevant filters.
Advanced Lead Search: The system must retrieve and filter company data based on predefined parameters.
Lead Data Display: The platform should present lead information in an interactive and exportable format (CSV, Excel).
Prospecting Automation: The system should allow users to manage and track leads efficiently.
Dashboard and Analytics: A visual interface for users to monitor their lead searches and interactions.
3. Technology Stack
Frontend: Built with Next.js and hosted on Vercel.
Backend & Database: Uses Supabase for authentication, data storage (PostgreSQL), and role-based access control.
Deployment & Version Control: Managed via GitHub and deployments with Vercel.
4. Compliance and Data Collection
The project must comply with GDPR regulations, ensuring that only publicly available company data is used.
Emails and phone numbers should only be retrieved if legally accessible through APIs or public sources.
Users should be able to manage their own data and request deletions as required by GDPR.
5. Security and Performance
Authentication: Implement Supabase Auth for secure login (email/password and OAuth).
Data Security: Protect user data through encrypted storage and strict database rules.
Scalability: Ensure that the architecture can handle multiple users performing searches without slowdowns.
6. Project Development and Workflow
Version Control: All code must be committed to GitHub with clear commit messages.
CI/CD Pipeline: Automatic deployments should be set up via Vercel.
Modular Development: Features should be developed incrementally, ensuring stability before adding complexity.
7. API and Third-Party Integrations
Data retrieval should be done via Supabase APIs or external APIs such as OpenCorporates, INSEE, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator (if legally compliant).
The platform must allow for integration with CRM systems to facilitate lead management.
8. Business Model and Monetization
The SaaS should operate on a subscription-based model, offering free limited access and premium tiers.
Lead data exports and advanced filtering options should be part of premium plans.
9. Rules for AI Assistance
AI assistance should always follow the requirements outlined in this document.
Features, security, and compliance must be respected in every AI-generated output.
AI should provide modular, scalable, and legally compliant solutions at all times.
By following these rules and principles, the project will ensure a structured and scalable approach while staying compliant with legal regulations and business requirements.
